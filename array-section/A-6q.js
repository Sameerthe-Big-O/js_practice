//!filter in range most tricky one in a sense when we remvoe the first element then the length will decrease by the one and the element that is on the 1th index will become the 0th one and the thing is that we need to solve that

//* the splice method mutates the original array and returns removed elements array;

//*it does include the starting index element

//*also when we sau that start from 0 and 3 that the 3 doesn't means te third index instead it'll be like three items

//*in the sklice it does same but don't include last index also it doesn't mutate the original array
